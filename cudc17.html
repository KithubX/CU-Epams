        <h1>CHITKARA UNIVERSITY DOCTORAL CONSORTIUM</h1>
        <p class="points">The rationale of CUDC-2017 is to provide a platform for Research Scholars in Management, Engineering, Pharmaceutical Sciences, Health Sciences and Applied Sciences to showcase their unique research ideas, real research problems and stimulate discussions on various emerging issues. CUDC-2017 will also bring together the researchers interested in the investigation of real world challenges. The consortium will provide PhD students with an opportunity to present their work to a group of mentors and peers from a diverse set of academic and industrial institutions, to receive feedback on their doctoral research plan and progress.</p>
        <br />
        <article>
        <h1 id="heading1">ABOUT US</h1>
        <p class="points">In line with UGC Notification No. F. 1-2/2009(EC/PS)V(I) Vol. II (Minimum Standards and Procedure for Award of M.PHIL./PH.D Degrees, Regulations, 2016) Ph.D. scholars must publish at least one (1) research paper in refereed journal and make two paper presentations in conferences/seminars before the submission of the dissertation/thesis (Clause 9.4, pp 11). Taking in to consideration the UGC guidelines, CUDC 2017 provides an opportunity for the PhD scholars to present/publish their research work and fulfil above mentioned requirement before the submission of the thesis. CUDC-2017 will also bring together the researchers interested in the investigation of real world challenges. The consortium will provide PhD students with an opportunity to present their work to a group of mentors and peers from a diverse set of academic and industrial institutions, to receive feedback on their doctoral research plan and progress.</p>
        <br /><h1>ABOUT THE UNIVERSITY</h1>
        <p class="points">In the year 2002, Chitkara Educational Trust established its Punjab campus 30 kilometers from Chandigarh, on the Chandigarh-Patiala National Highway. In the year 2010 Chitkara University was established by the Punjab State Legislature under "The Chitkara University Act". Chitkara University, the best university in Punjab, is a government-recognized university with the right to confer degrees as per the Sections 2(f) and 22(1) of the UGC Act, 1956. The University offers multi-disciplinary programs, all of which are designed to be industry-relevant. As a result of this student-centric approach, Chitkara University is rated as one of the best private universities in the North India region. Chitkara University has been established with a mission to pursue excellence in every sphere in the field of education, and to adhere to the highest standards of academic rigour in all its work. The University is fast moving towards attaining leadership position in north India, which speaks volumes about its enduring commitment, outstanding faculty and rich learning environment. From business management programs to programs in nursing and medical laboratory technologies; and from computer science, electronics and mechanical engineering programs, to hotel management and architecture-Chitkara University, Punjab is a veritable cornucopia of educational services. Chitkara University also offers PhD Programmes in Business Management, Engineering, Pharmaceutical Sciences, Health Sciences and Education. The Chitkara Ph.D program is designed to produce a new generation of scholar-teacher-practitioners who precisely fit that description.</p>
        <br /><h1>OVERVIEW</h1>
        <p class="points">The objective of this consortium is to provide PhD students with an opportunity to present their work to a group of mentors and peers from a diverse set of academic and industrial institutions. The presenters will receive feedback on their doctoral research plan and way forward. We invite PhD students who have completed their coursework and are in the process of forming or carrying out a plan for their PhD research.</p>
        <br /><h1>WHO SHOULD APPLY?</h1>
        <p class="points">The doctoral consortium will benefit most the students who are in the process of forming or developing their doctoral research. The PhD students must have completed their coursework and should not have submitted the final thesis as yet. PhD students who still have not completed the data collection stage are also encouraged to apply (Please refer to the template for more clarity). PhD students whose research fall within criteria as mentioned above are encouraged to apply.</p>
        <p class="points">Those who do not intend to submit the paper or still thinking of registering in the PhD are also encouraged to participate as active listeners. Such participants shall be given a certificate of participation and passes for attending all technical sessions.</p>
        <br /><h1>CONSORTIUM TAKEAWAYS</h1>
        <p class="points">CUDC-2017 will bring together the researchers interested in the investigation of real world challenges. The consortium will provide PhD students with an opportunity to present their work to a group of mentors and peers from a diverse set of academic and industrial institutions, to receive feedback on their doctoral research plan and progress. The interactions with the mentors and peers will provide constructive feedback to develop further the research plans and way forward for the same.</p>
        <p class="points">CUDC 2017 will provide a platform to potentially present your work in Scopus Indexed Journals and definitely in consortium proceeding.</p>
        <p class="points">The consortium will also provide an opportunity to attend keynote talks by leading researchers and industry professionals. Finally, we hope to achieve a diversity of research topics, disciplinary backgrounds and methodological approaches in this inaugural Chitkara University doctoral consortium.</p>
