             <p>Chitkara University's ACM Student Chapter chartered on 28 February in 2010 and the chapter commenced on March 8 in the same year. The chapter was initiated with a goal to generate curiosity among the students for impending technologies in computer science apart from the regular course content.</p>
             <p>The chapter constantly endeavours to amplify the practical expertise of its members through expert talks, industry-oriented hands-on courses, workshops, industrial visits, quizzes and debugging and coding competitions.</p>
             <br />
             <h5>Various timely activities are organized and operated exclusively for educational and scientific purposes in order to:</h5>
             <ul>
                 <li>Increase and improvise the knowledge of upcoming research fields in science, design, development, languages, management.</li>
                 <li>Improve interest in computing and its applications.</li>
             </ul><br />
             <h5>Activities at ACM</h5>
             <p>Many students have been inspired to be a part of the National-level event 'Learn 'n'' Code and 'Innovaci'' on', an event on presentation skills. These events saw members of the society and non-members gather on a common platform to check their learning and analytical skills.</p>
             <p>ACM believes in 'Learning by Doing', standing by this motto, workshops on Android 'Application Development' were organised and a six-day workshop on 'Programming with Python' was conducted. Student members who were well versed taught other students the art of developing algorithms using real life examples.</p>
             <img src="#" height="200px" width="200px" alt="" align="right"/>
             <p>The ACM student chapter is now gearing up for International Conference on Advances in Computing and Artificial Intelligence (ACAI 2013). The aim of this conference is providing a platform for faculty, researchers and designers from academia and industry to present their research ideas, share their experiences, and challenges in the field of Computing, and Artificial Intelligence. Lectures on upcoming technologies like cloud computing and research areas in network security are a regular at ACM.</p>
             <p>A Project Display Competition titled 'AARDA' is organized every semester to facilitate students to showcase their projects.
                The contest was meant for members as well as non-members. Students displayed their talent through various projects made under academia and the best project was awarded.
             </p>
             <p>Through unending support provided by the chapter officers and faculty sponsor, tremendous enthusiasm has been instilled among the chapter officers to lead, inspire, explore, motivate and learn.
              It is through this support that Chitkara ACM Student Chapter is one of the best Student Chapters in Chitkara University.</p>
