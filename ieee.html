             <p>IEEE is the world's largest professional association, which is dedicated to taking technological innovation forward.
              The global community derives inspiration from IEEE and its members through its publications, conferences, technology standards, professional and educational activities.</p>
             <p>Members collaborate through a platform provided by the IEEE on world-changing technologies, from computing and sustainable energy systems, to aerospace, communications, robotics, healthcare, and more.
              More and more lives have been touched by IEEE's role over the decades that have followed.</p>
             <p>IEEE Societies comprises professional groups and technical boards of the predecessor institutions. There were 38 societies by the early 21st Century, through which the IEEE served its members and their interests; apart from 130 journals, there are transactions and magazines; more 300 conferences annually and 900 active standards.</p>
             <p>This was the time when the virtual world became more compact, all a part of a global network connected by satellites and then by fiber optics.
              The area of interest of IEEE was not limited to electrical/electronic engineering and computing, it expanded to areas such as micro- and nanotechnology, ultrasonics, bioengineering, robotics, electronic materials, and many others.</p>
             <p>Electronics became omnipresent. We could not do without them. IEEE kept an account of every possible innovation that was made and become a global institution, which used the innovations of the practitioners it represented in order to enhance its own excellence in delivering products and services to members, industries, and the public at large.</p>
             <p>Publications and educational programs were delivered online, as were member services such as renewal and elections. By 2010, IEEE had over 395,000 members in 160 countries.
              Through its worldwide network of geographical units, publications, web services, and conferences, IEEE remains the world's largest technical professional association.</p>
