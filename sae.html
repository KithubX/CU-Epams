             <p>SAEINDIA is India's leading resource for mobility technology. As an individual member driven society of mobility practitioners the ownership of SAEINDIA wrests with its members who are Individuals from the mobility community, which includes Engineers Executives from Industry, Government Officials, Academics and Students.</p>
             <p>SAEINDIA is an affiliate society of SAE International registered in India as an Indian nonprofit engineering and scientific society dedicated to the advancement of mobility industry in India.</p>
             <p>The officers in Section Governing Boards, Operating Boards and Committees share the onus of its efficient functioning here. All efforts are on now with a single-minded purpose to propel the automotive engineering profession by focusing on three trends occurring in the automotive industry today that affect all automotive engineers and engineering societies.</p>
             <p>The first of these trends is simultaneous engineering the integration of the roles of design engineer, manufacturing engineer, supplier, marketer, and planner. The second trend is the increased reliance of auto manufacturers on suppliers and design houses to support the design and manufacturing functions. A third factor crucial to an internationalized auto industry is standards as communication, as a basis for regulation, and as an aid to interchangeability.</p>
             <p>Global standards have become a necessity, and the responsibility for developing them falls on internationally recognized standards-writing groups and, ultimately, on the individual engineers who participate in standards work.</p>
             <p>During its hundred plus years, the automotive industry has achieved remarkable progress in both production output and technological development. However, associated with this progress has been a slight yet noticeable lag in the level of technological development as compared to the increase in production volume.</p>

             <h5>Principle of SAE</h5>
             <p>The founding principle of the SAE International is to unite scientific and technical staff to perform free academic discussions, to dedicate themselves to the cause of prospering the science and technology for automotive vehicles and to make contributions to speed up the modernization of automotive industry.</p>
