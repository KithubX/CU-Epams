        <h1>OBJECTIVE OF THE CONFERENCE:</h1>
        <p>Drug discovery is based on identification of possible receptors and physiological processes which can be intercepted for appropriate drug
           targeting and action. Efficacy of drug action is after related to levels of typical biomarkers in blood which increases or decreases depending on
           disease conditions example, CRP protein in inflammation, There is potential scope for further improvement. 5th Annual international
           conference, being the most innovative event, aims to provide an open and stimulating scientific and cultural exchange that will give all the
           participants the opportunity to share their experiences, foster collaborations across industry and academia and evaluate emerging technologies
           across the globe. Biomarkers are biological molecules for measuring the progress of disease or therapeutic efficacy of treatments, serving as
           early warning signs for various chronic and acute diseases and helping identify potential existence of transformed, pre-malignant cells and
           tissues. Biomarkers may beEarly detection biomarkers for identifyingearly disease states, Diagnostic biomarkersfor identifyingparticular
           disease state, Prognostic biomarkersfor determining survival probabilities, Predictive biomarkersfor predicting efficacy of drug
           therapies,Translation biomarkers in preclinical and clinical settings, Disease biomarkersfor measures of disease states, Efficacy biomarkers for
           efficiency of treatment, Surrogate biomarkers as valid substitutes for measuring clinical outcomes, Toxicity biomarkers for in vitro & in vivo
           drug toxicity.Target biomarkers report the interactions of drugs with their targets. Because of the diverse types of biomarkers, the many
           sources of new biomarkers and the various methods used to discover and validate them, there is an equally impressive set of bioinformatics
           tools available for biomarker analysis. DNA, RNA, protein and antibody microarrays are commonly used for biomarker analysis. The
           comparison of plasma protein concentration levels in normal and diseased states is often used in biomarker analysis and a Plasma Proteome
           database containing annotated lists of plasma proteins, protein isoforms (multiple 3D shapes derived from alternative splicing) and posttranslational
           modifications helps in developments. The program will consist of moderated sessions and engaging an expert panel on research
           themes at the core of genomics, proteomics, biomarkers, drug discovery & development.</p>

            <h1>CHITKARA COLLEGE OF PHARMACY</h1>
            <p>Chitkara College of Pharmacy was started in 2005 by the Chitkara Education Trust, Chandigarh, under the guidance of renowned
academicians Dr. Ashok Chitkara and Dr. (Mrs.) Madhu Chitkara. Chitkara Educational group campus is located at Jhansla, Rajpura and the
campus has institutions including Chitkara College of Pharmacy, Chitkara Institute of Engineering and Technology, Chitkara School of
Planning and Architecture, Chitkara School of Education, Chitkara School of Hospitality Management, Chitkara Business School. The
different institutes have relevant accreditations including National Councils, ISO and NAAC. The campus is hosting degree and Post degree
level courses in Pharmacy, Electrical Engineering, Computer Science and Engineering, Electronics and Communication Engineering and
Mechanical Engineering, Architecture, Education, Management, Media and Health Sciences. Chitkara College of Pharmacy has courses B.
Pharm, M. Pharm, Pharm D and Ph. D approved by AICTE, PCI & UGC and affiliated to Chitkara University, Punjab. The institute has highly
qualified faculty, well equipped laboratories, high speed internet facility and a very well equipped library. The college has comprehensive
research portfolios with more than 20 patents, 250 publications, 120 PG thesis and Ph.D program going for making it a premier centre for
higher education in Pharmaceutical Sciences.</p>
             <p>Chitkara College of Pharmacy aced the 'India Rankings 2016' released by the Ministry of Human Resource Development by bagging 17th
position from a total of 750 Pharmacy Colleges and Institutes. Parameters for the ranking included learning resources, research &
collaborative performance, graduation outcome, outreach & inclusivity and perception. Interestingly, Chitkara College of Pharmacy, Chitkara
University is one of the only two colleges to reach the top 100 ranking among colleges of Punjab. NIRF provides a methodology that has
helped them to rank institutions across India. The methodology is derived after recommendations by a Core Committee set up by MHRD. The
committee identified the broad parameters that would be used to identify a fair and logical ranking.</p>

           <p>Posters should be prepared as per following guidelines.
              Title: Use a title representative of the scientific contents of your research work. Introduction and research question: State what is known, what
              is unknown, your research question and experimental approach. Materials and Methods: Explain what experiments/techniques you used in
              order to answer your research question. State the function of every technique/measurement and if necessary, explain why you have chosen
              certain techniques. Remember to keep confined to essential details. Results: Only report results that are relevant to your research question.
              Results may include a few data, but most data should be given in clear figures & tables, these are more accessible for the audience. Conclusion:
